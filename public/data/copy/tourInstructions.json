    "If you choose to take the tour, please allow yourself **between 2.5 - 3 hours** to complete the walking tour all in one visit. You can start the tour by pressing the {{takeTour}} button. You may choose to only do a portion of the tour and come back at a later time. The tour will remember which markers you have already visited and allow you to begin where you left off.",
    "The first stop on the tour is at **first marker location**. From there the map will prompt you to the next stop with an orange marker. You may choose to visit any marker at any time but the loop we have curated will help you visit every stop in an efficient manner. Completed stops are noted with green pins and remaining stops are noted with blue pins. To mark content as completed, press the {{completed}} check box on the content page.",
