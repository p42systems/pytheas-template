    "The key to this walking tour is basic. It is about local visibility of the 2SLGBTQAI community. Unfortunately, much of that visibility has been erased for various reasons. Some of those reasons are as simple as the suppression of our identities, the lack of interest in who we are, overall hate or ignorance, and our own lack of seeing the importance of our stories and struggles.",
    "When creating the tour, some of the examples were difficult to prove if they “really” were queer, trans, or gender non-conforming references, especially before the 1960s. I included them anyways because one could argue either way if the experience was queer, trans, or gender non-conforming.",
    "I must acknowledge the hard work and dedication of the Windsor Essex Rainbow Alliance (WERA). WERA is a group of individuals whose goals are to institute a method of collecting, preserving, and disseminating the local history of the 2SLGBTQIA+ community and to establish a permanent public monument that will showcase the struggles, achievements, and celebrations of the local 2SLGBTQIA+ community for all in Windsor/Essex and beyond to visit, learn from, and enjoy. There are still so many voices, stories, and places that have not been told and could be lost forever. It is my goal to help change that reality.",
    "If you have any materials (newsletters, pictures, posters, buttons, shirts, etc.) you would like to have preserved or if you find any information that is not included in this tour and would like to make a request for an update or something changed, please contact me <a>by email<a>."
