It became federally incorporated in 2017, and in 2018, had a grand opening for its first independent space on 536 Pelissier on May 1st, before later relocating to 111 Wyandotte Street West. That same year, Jayce Carver won recognition as a 40 Under 40 Outstanding Individual in Windsor-Essex. In 2021, it changed its name to Trans Wellness Ontario (TWO). As of 2023, the organization is housed at 1435 Tecumseh Road East.
