{"id": "825rdw", "url": null, "description": "In 1977, the Gay Alliance Toward Equality (GATE) in Halifax first protested CBC after it refused to include their ads for Gay social events in their public service announcements. GATE called for the CRTC to “deny the license renewal of CBC radio outlets until the CBC publicly repudiates its discriminatory policy of refusing public service announcements submitted by homosexual organizations.” Other cities, including Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Winnipeg, Vancouver, and Windsor, also began to protest the CBC policy and write to the CRTC. Windsor Gay Unity filed an application against a license renewal to the Windsor CBC outlet CBET in December 1978. In response, Margaret Butcher, the public relations manager for Windsor CBC, stated: “We maintain a corporate policy that refuses public service announcements from homosexual organizations.” Starting in 1979, there was a boycott of CBC by gay organizations for two years across the country. In the early 1980s, CBC Windsor also rejected public service announcements about Windsor's Gay Awareness Week. WGU continued to fight back, and in 1985, CBC changed its policy across the country.", "image": null}
