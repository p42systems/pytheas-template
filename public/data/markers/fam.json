The city was involved, and the current mayor John Millson was present. The tree does not exist anymore. There is a memorial tree in the park for David Buck however, who was a volunteer for the AIDS Committee of Windsor before his death in 1996. WERA is currently working with Pozitive Pathways to create a permanent monument in the park.", "image": "/photos/fam.png"}
