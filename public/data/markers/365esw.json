{"id": "365esw", "url": null, "description": ["The 25-year-old Carlos Rivera was a first-year architecture student at St. Clair College. Rivera would also paint and write poetry in his spare time. In 2006, he was found strangled by a belt in the house of the alleged killer's home. His killer went on the run and later killed 72-year-old William Regier and his 73-year-old wife Helen in Grand Bend, shooting both of them multiple times, before relocating to Québec. By that time, there was a two-week nationwide manhunt for him. He was captured in Québec and convicted of three counts of second-degree murder. He will be eligible for parole in 2033. In 2019, the killer tried to sue Maryvale for sexual assault when he spent a few months there in 1996-1997 but his claim was dismissed. A year after Rivera was murdered, a book of poetry of his was published. Entitled ”Breaking Down the Wall of Silence”, it contained the lines: ”I close my eyes and imagine a white gate - That opens the frontier to a divine world. Its tiled golden streets lead through a silver city full of love, happiness, prosperity, and peace.”"], "timeline": null, "image": null}
