If that were done, people could feel more at ease. As long as these perverts are allowed to run free, they are a menace to everyone. One suspect is under arrest, but others are at large. With so many persons being slashed, Windsor will have another couple of murders on the sheet before long. To save human life, it would be advisable to round up all the perverts and hold them for observation.”"}], "description": "In 1945, the first of the Windsor Slasher murders were discovered. This was the first known serial killer in Canada who specifically targeted queer men. The killer would approach them in Riverside parks and stab them repeatedly in the back. George Mannie, Frank Sciegliski, and Sgt. Hugh Blackwood Price were the first three victims. In 1946, the slasher attacks continued with Alexander Voligny and Joseph Gelencser. The murderer was ultimately caught in September of that year.", "timeline": null, "image": "/photos/ws1.png"}
